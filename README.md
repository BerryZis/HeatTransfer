# HeatTransfer

Heat transfer graphical simulation for 2 objects in respect for:
- Mass [Kg] 
- Capacity [KJ/KgC]
- Condctivity [KJ/sec*C]

The simulation will show the objects temperature during the heat transfer.

The simulation can be exported to a graph for further analysis.

Created for practice as part of my "Embedded systems" course during 3rd year of my BSc studies.
